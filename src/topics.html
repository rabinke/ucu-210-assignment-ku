<h2>INTRODUCTION TO SALTS</h2>

<div style="text-align: center;">

<div class="salt">
    1.(a) A salt is an ionic compound formed when the cation from a base combine
with the anion derived from an acid.<br>
A salt is therefore formed when the hydrogen ions in an acid are replaced
wholly/fully or partially/partly ,directly or indirectly by a metal or ammonium
radical.
</div>

<div  class="salt">
    (b) The number of ionizable/replaceable hydrogen in an acid is called basicity
of an acid.<br>
Some acids are therefore:
</div>
<div class="salt" style="margin-left: 10px;">(i)monobasic acids generally denoted HX e.g.</div>
<div id="eqn">HCl, HNO3,HCOOH,CH3COOH.</div>
<div class="salt"style="margin-left: 10px;">(ii)dibasic acids ; generally denoted H2X e.g.</div>
<div id="eqn">H2SO4, H2SO3, H2CO3,HOOCOOH.</div>
<div class="salt" style="margin-left: 10px;">(iii)tribasic acids ; generally denoted H3X e.g.</div>
<div id="eqn">H3PO4.</div>
<div class="salt">(c) Some salts are normal salts while other are acid salts.</div>
<div></div>
<div class="salt" style="margin-left: 10px;">(i)A normal salt is formed when all the ionizable /replaceable hydrogen in
    an acid is replaced by a metal or metallic /ammonium radical.</div>
<div class="salt" style="margin-left: 10px;">(ii)An acid salt is formed when part/portion the ionizable /replaceable
    hydrogen in an acid is replaced by a metal or metallic /ammonium radical.</div>
<div class="salt">(d) Some salts undergo <b>hygroscopy, deliquescence</b> and <b>efflorescence.</b></div>
<div class="salt" style="margin-left: 10px;">(i) Hygroscopic salts /compounds are those that absorb water from the atmosphere
    but do not form a solution.
    Some salts which are hygroscopic include anhydrous copper(II)sulphate(VI),
    anhydrous cobalt(II)chloride, potassium nitrate(V) common table salt.</div>
<div class="salt"style="margin-left: 10px;">(ii)Deliquescent salts /compounds are those that absorb water from the atmosphere
    and form a solution.
    Some salts which are deliquescent include: Sodium nitrate(V),Calcium chloride,
    Sodium hydroxide, Iron(II)chloride, Magnesium chloride.</div>
<div class="salt"style="margin-left: 10px;">(iii)Efflorescent salts/compounds are those that lose their water of crystallization
    to the atmosphere.
    Some salts which effloresces include: sodium carbonate decahydrate,
    Iron(II)sulphate(VI)heptahydrate, sodium sulphate (VI)decahydrate.</div>
<div class="salt">(e)Some salts contain water of crystallization.They are hydrated.Others do not
    contain water of crystallization. They are anhydrous.</div>
<div class="salt"style="margin-left: 10px;" id="example" ><h3>Name of hydrated salt and Chemical formula</h3>
    <div id="example">Copper(II)sulphate(VI)pentahydrate CuSO4.5H2O</div>
    <div id="example">Aluminium(III)sulphate(VI)hexahydrate Al2 (SO4) 3.6H2O</div>
    <div id="example">Zinc(II)sulphate(VI)heptahydrate ZnSO4.7H2O</div>
    <div id="example">Iron(II)sulphate(VI)heptahydrate FeSO4.7H2O</div>
    <div id="example">Calcium(II)sulphate(VI)heptahydrate CaSO4.7H2O</div>
    <div id="example">Magnesium(II)sulphate(VI)heptahydrate MgSO4.7H2O</div>
    <div id="example">Sodium sulphate(VI)decahydrate Na2SO4.10H2O</div>
    <div id="example">Sodium carbonate(IV)decahydrate Na2CO3.10H2O</div>
    <div id="example">Potassium carbonate(IV)decahydrate K2CO3.10H2O</div>
    <div id="example"> Potassium sulphate(VI)decahydrate K2SO4.10H2O</div></div>
    <div id="example"></div>
    <div id="example"></div>
    
    <div class="salt">(f)Some salts exist as a simple salt while some as complex salts. Below are some
        complex salts.</div>
        <div id="example">Tetraamminecopper(II)sulphate
            Tetraamminezinc(II)nitrate(V) 
            Tetraamminecopper(II) nitrate(V)</div>
    <div class="salt">(g)Some salts exist as two salts in one. They are called<b> double salts.</b></div>
    <div id="example">Trona(sodium sesquicarbonate)
        Ammonium iron(II)sulphate(VI) 
        Ammonium aluminium(III)sulphate(VI)</div>

    <div class="salt">(h)Some salts dissolve in water to form a <b>solution</b>. They are said to be soluble.
        Others do not dissolve in water. They form a <b>suspension/precipitate </b>in water.</div>
        
    <div class="salt">13 Salts can be prepared in a school laboratory by a method that uses its solubility
        in water.</div>
    <div id="example">(a) Soluble salts may be prepared by using any of the following methods:</div>
    <div class="salt"><h3>(i)Direct displacement/reaction of a metal with an acid.</h3></div>
    <div id="example">By reacting a metal higher in the reactivity series than hydrogen with a dilute
        acid,a salt is formed and hydrogen gas is evolved.
        Excess of the metal must be used to ensure all the acid has reacted.
        When effervescence/bubbling /fizzing has stopped ,excess metal is filtered.
        The filtrate is heated to concentrate then allowed to crystallize.
        Washing with distilled water then drying between filter papers produces a sample
        crystal of the salt. i.e.<br>
        M(s) + H2X -> MX(aq) + H2(g)</div>
        <div class="salt"><h3>(ii)Reaction of an insoluble base with an acid</h3></div>
    <div id="example">By adding an insoluble base (oxide/hydroxide )to a dilute acid until no more
        dissolves, in the acid,a salt and water are formed. Excess of the base is filtered off.
        The filtrate is heated to concentrate ,allowed to crystallize then washed with
        distilled water before drying between filter papers</div>
    <div class="salt"><h3>(iv)neutralization/reaction of soluble base/alkali with dilute acid</h3></div>
    <div id="example">By adding an acid to a burette into a known volume of an alkali with 2-3 drops of
        an indicator, the colour of the indicator changes when the acid has completely
        reacted with an alkali at the end point. The procedure is then repeated without the
        indicator .The solution mixture is then heated to concentrate , allowed to crystallize
        ,washed with distilled water before drying with filter papers.</div>
    <div class="salt"><h3>(iv)direct synthesis/combination.</h3></div>
    <div id="example">When a metal burn in a gas jar containing a non metal , the two directly combine
        to form a salt. e.g.<br>
        2Na(s) + Cl2(g) -> 2NaCl(s)<br>
        2K(s) + Cl2(g) -> 2KCl(s)<br>
        Mg(s) + Cl2(g) -> Mg Cl2 (s)<br>
        Ca(s) + Cl2(g) -> Ca Cl2 (s)<br>
        Some salts once formed undergo sublimation and hydrolysis. Care should be
        taken to avoid water/moisture into the reaction flask during their preparation.Such
        salts include aluminium(III)chloride(AlCl3) and iron (III)chloride(FeCl3)</div>
